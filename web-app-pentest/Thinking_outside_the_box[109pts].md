> I hope all these login pages are done securely.

### Write-up

- looking at chat with Henry;
- heâ€™s having an error logging into the org. site as a **member**
- so lets logout and then force an error. Cool, so we get a return error of `Invalid option selected for parameter 'user'` 
- we see that the sign on integration is running through `user=individual` and we decide to change it to `user=organisation`;
- we are prompted with an org. login form
- we know that the user name is henry and that the server is running SQL
- push username as `henry` and password as `' or 1=1--` 
- profit
